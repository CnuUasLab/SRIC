Running tests
-------------
to un the tests run: `./run_tests` in the root directory of the Repository.

Part 1
======
The first part of the objective is to test the connectivity of a network. This is the first part that's dealt with in the test cases.

When checking the connectivity of any IP Address or URL you must put `<b>http://</b>` at the beginning. This is important for the functionality of the method in the script.

For instance, say you wanted to check the connectivity of IP 0.0.0.0, you would have to enter in the parameter in the method as `http://0.0.0.0`.

Before running the test cases a node server called <b>helloworld.js</b> has been created, you must run this server before runningthe test cases.

<b> NOTE: You must have nodejs installed to run this node server before running the testcases: `./run_tests`</b>
