# Parsing Module

File Parsing
===========

This module helps us extract credential files from text files that are taken by the information center.

Inorder to run a testfile choose one of the files in the <b>testfiles</b> folder and run the python script with the filename and extension after it. This would be such as testing the extraction of credentials from the file <b>sample.txt</b> by running: `python __file_parse__.py sample.txt`
